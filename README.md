## Description

 This full-stack site will take in user input (the name of any burger) and allow the user to then devour their burger. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Once it has been devoured, the burger will then appear on the right side of the page, eliminating it from being devoured by another user.
